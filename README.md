# Sorting-Algorithms-Visualization



Sorting algorithms, we all love them. This is a visualizaiton program made in c++ using raylib C library for game development. It has one small bug that we are going to call a feature. For some reason quick sort doesn't work if it's called last haha, I'll try to fix it in the future. 

Enjoy using this program!

# Sorting-Algorithms-Visualization



Sorting algorithms, we all love them. This is a visualizaiton program made in c++ using raylib C library for game development. It has one small bug that we are going to call a feature. For some reason quick sort doesn't work if it's called last haha, I'll try to fix it in the future. 


Also sorry for the weird names. I made each visualization seperatelly so it's called like that because I combined all of them. The "Combinations.cpp" contains all the code for the visualizations and the "compileAllcpp.sh" is a shell script that I just have the long g++ command in to run the file. 

if you have bash or zsh you can either run it via "sh compilbeAllcpp.sh" or u can lituraly just copy the command in it and past it on the console to comiple the cpp file.


Also This will not work unless you have raylib library installed, so be sure to do that.
(I will not provide a link because I forgot where I downloaded it from... :/ )

Good luck and 

Enjoy using this program!
